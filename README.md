# Caesar-Cipher-Encryption-Decryption
Introduction 
The Caesar Cipher is an old and easy way to hide messages by shifting each letter in a word a fixed number of places in the alphabet.
It’s named after Julius Caesar, who used it to keep his military messages secret. It’s a type of substitution cipher, where each letter is replaced by another.  
Historical Context
Julius Caesar (100–44 BCE) used a shift of 3 to encrypt messages sent to his generals. His nephew Augustus also employed a similar cipher with a shift of 1.  
The purpose of employing the technique was to prevent enemies from understanding intercepted communications, especially during wartime.
